## Goal Creation Guidelines

1. **Copy from template:** Use `00-Template-Goal/` as starting point
2. **Follow numbering:** Goals are `01-10-*`, tasks are `Task-01-*`
3. **Update this index:** Add new goals to the table above
4. **Reference, don't duplicate:** Link to detailed scratchpads instead of copying content

---

## Notes

- Each goal has its own directory under `.agent/goals/`
- Goals contain a `scratchpad.md` and one or more `Task-XX/` subdirectories
- Tasks are atomic, actionable units of work within a goal
- Follow `.rules` workflow: Research → Plan → Pitch → Implement → Document
