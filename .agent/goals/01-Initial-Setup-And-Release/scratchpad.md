# Goal 01: Initial Setup & Release v0.0.0

> Complete post-generation setup and validate the entire release pipeline

---

## Status: 🟡 In Progress

**Created:** 2025-01-01
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours

---

## Objective

Validate that Legal-MCP works correctly after generation by:
1. Setting up the development environment
2. Running all tests and quality checks
3. Publishing version 0.0.0 to test the complete release pipeline
4. Verifying all workflows function end-to-end

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Development environment setup complete (`uv sync` works)
- [ ] All tests pass (`pytest` with variable tests)
- [ ] Code quality checks pass (`ruff check` and `ruff format --check`)
- [ ] CI workflow passes on GitHub
- [ ] Version 0.0.0 successfully published to PyPI
- [ ] Docker image builds and publishes (if enabled)
- [ ] All workflows verified: CI → Release → Publish → CD

---

## Context & Background

This is the foundational goal for every generated project. The .rules file emphasizes:
> **First version is always 0.0.0** - Tests both initial implementation AND release workflow

Publishing 0.0.0 immediately serves two purposes:
1. **Validates the code works** - All tests pass, no import errors
2. **Validates the release pipeline** - Packaging, PyPI publishing, Docker builds all function

This goal follows the .rules philosophy of building confidence through incremental releases: `0.0.0 → 0.0.x → 0.1.0 → 1.0.0`

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Local Environment Setup
- [ ] Run `uv sync` to install dependencies
- [ ] Verify Python 3.12 is being used
- [ ] Check project structure matches expected layout

### Phase 2: Code Quality Verification
- [ ] Run `pytest` - expect variable passing tests
- [ ] Run `ruff check . --fix && ruff format .` - no issues
- [ ] Run `uv run python -c "import legal_mcp; print('Import successful')"` - verify package imports

### Phase 3: Git and CI Setup
- [ ] Initialize git repository (if not already done)
- [ ] Set up GitHub repository: `l4b4r4b4b4/legal-mcp`
- [ ] Push initial commit to main branch
- [ ] Verify CI workflow passes (should run automatically on push)

### Phase 4: Release Pipeline Testing
- [ ] Create and push tag `v0.0.0`: `git tag v0.0.0 && git push origin v0.0.0`
- [ ] Verify Release workflow creates GitHub release
- [ ] Verify Publish workflow uploads to PyPI
- [ ] Verify Docker image builds and pushes to registry

### Phase 5: Verification
- [ ] Confirm package is available on PyPI: `https://pypi.org/project/legal-mcp/`
- [ ] Test installation in clean environment: `pip install legal-mcp==0.0.0`
- [ ] Verify MCP server starts: `legal-mcp`

## Configuration Summary

**Template Variant:** custom
**Components Included:**
- ❌ Demo tools (minimal server only)
- ✅ Secret tools (API key demonstrations)
- ❌ Langfuse integration (no observability)

**Expected Test Count:** Variable based on selected options

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| `uv sync` fails | Missing Python 3.12 | Install Python 3.12 with pyenv/conda |
| Tests fail | Template generation issue | Check for leftover `{{cookiecutter.*}}` placeholders |
| CI fails | Missing GitHub secrets | Add required secrets to repository settings |
| PyPI publish fails | Package name taken | Choose different `project_slug` in cookiecutter |
| Docker build fails | Missing dependencies | Check Dockerfile has all required packages |

### Validation Commands

```bash
# Quick validation sequence
uv sync
pytest --tb=short
ruff check . --fix && ruff format .
uv run python -c "import legal_mcp; print('✅ Import successful')"
```

---

## Dependencies

**Upstream:** None (this is the foundation goal)
**Downstream:** All future development depends on this working

---

## Notes & Decisions

### Why 0.0.0 First?
From .rules: "Starting at 0.0.0 accomplishes two critical goals:
1. **Tests implementation** - Validates the initial code works  
2. **Tests release workflow** - Forces you to get packaging right from day one"

The 0.0.0 release signals "experimental test release - expect issues" which is honest for a newly generated project.

### Template-Specific Expectations



**Custom Variant:** User-selected features. Test count varies based on included components.
